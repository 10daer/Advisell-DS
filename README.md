# Advisell Design System Setup

This document outlines the setup for the Advisell design system, inspired by the Turborepo Design System. The setup ensures a scalable, modular structure for future component additions.

## Features

- **Monorepo**: Managed using Turborepo.
- **Storybook**: Latest version with autogenerated documentation, located in `apps/docs`.
- **Libraries**:
  - `packages/ui`: For reusable UI elements using React v19 (compatible with React v17) and CSS Modules.
  - `packages/design`: For design tokens and assets, with initial placeholders for customization.
- **Build & Test**: Vite for building libraries and Vitest for testing.
- **CI/CD**: GitLab integration for changelog generation, beta package publishing for merge requests, and stable publishing on main branch merges.

## Setup Overview

1. **Monorepo Initialization**: Set up with Turborepo.
2. **Storybook**: Configure for component documentation in `apps/docs`.
3. **Libraries**: 
   - Create `packages/ui` for UI elements.
   - Create `packages/design` for design tokens and assets.
4. **Compatibility**: Ensure `packages/ui` supports React v17 and v19.
5. **Testing**: Use Vitest for unit tests.
6. **CI/CD**: Implement GitLab pipelines for automated testing, changelog generation, and package publishing.

## Next Steps

- Add components to `packages/ui`.
- Update design tokens in `packages/design`.
- Integrate the system with existing projects as needed.
